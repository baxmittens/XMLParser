For extensive use of XML features, consider using one of the following XML-libraries: [LightXML.jl](https://github.com/JuliaIO/LightXML.jl), [EzXML.jl](https://github.com/JuliaIO/EzXML.jl).


There exists another XML library [XML.jl](https://github.com/joshday/XML.jl) purely written in Julia.

### Unsupported features

* It is not allowed to use one of the following characters in XML content: `<`,`>`

There are probably many more XML features that are not supported at the moment.
